# reboot-strategy: One of "reboot", "etcd-lock", "best-effort" or "off" for controlling when reboots are issued after an update is performed.
#  reboot: Reboot immediately after an update is applied.
#   etcd-lock: Reboot after first taking a distributed lock in etcd, this guarantees that only one host will reboot concurrently and that the cluster will remain available during the update.
#   best-effort - If etcd is running, "etcd-lock", otherwise simply "reboot".
#   off - Disable rebooting after updates are applied (not recommended).

# Each item is an object with the following fields:
#   name: String representing unit's name. Required.
#   runtime: Boolean indicating whether or not to persist the unit across reboots. This is analogous to the --runtime argument to systemctl enable. The default value is false.
#   enable: Boolean indicating whether or not to handle the [Install] section of the unit file. This is similar to running systemctl enable <name>. The default value is false.
#   content: Plaintext string representing entire unit file. If no value is provided, the unit is assumed to exist already.
#   command: Command to execute on unit: start, stop, reload, restart, try-restart, reload-or-restart, reload-or-try-restart. The default behavior is to not execute any commands.
#   mask: Whether to mask the unit file by symlinking it to /dev/null (analogous to systemctl mask <name>). Note that unlike systemctl mask, this will destructively remove any existing unit file located at /etc/systemd/system/<unit>, to ensure that the mask succeeds. The default value is false.
#   drop-ins: A list of unit drop-ins with the following fields:
#     name: String representing unit's name. Required.
#     content: Plaintext string representing entire file. Required.
